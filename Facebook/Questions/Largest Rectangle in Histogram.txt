Given n non-negative integers representing the histogramâ€™s bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

Example :

Given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3],
return 10.

Explaination : The largest rectangle that can be formed will be of base 2 (consists of bar of heights 5 and 6) and will be of height 5 (min of 5 and 6) and hence max area = 5*2 =10
